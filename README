## C++ Terminal Space Game
This is a small project that I am making to get some experience using C++.

Currently using ncurses for output.

I have been developing and testing on Ubuntu through WSL on Windows 10.

## Installation
You will need to have gcc, cmake, and ncurses installed.

To install ncurses on ubuntu use `apt install libncurses5-dev`


## Controls
Currently you can use 'w' to move forward/up, 'a' to move left, 'd' to move right, and 's' to slow down.
The 'q' key will rotate you left and the 'e' key will rotate you right so you can turn.
